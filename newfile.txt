=> Creating new branch from terminal 
	* Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.
		git pull
	* Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
		git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
	* Push the branch on github :
		git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
	* You can see all branches created by using :
		git branch -a
